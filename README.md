## Test Answers

  

**1. Describe the data you would capture as part of this service.**

- Movie URL

- Movie Meta information (category, duration, tags, synopsis)

- Date saved (for ordering purposes)

**2. How would make this service more efficient?**

Can cache data inside the browser using localStorage and only make an API request if the data is not present

**3. Once the feature is complete, how would you know that itâ€™s ready for go-live?**

If it has been tested rigorously on a large dataset and over many VOD devices/platforms, giving priority to devices that are in high usage.

**4. How would you determine if this feature is successful?**

Can use an analytics tool to measure the feature usage.

This feature could be considered successful if saved videos are actually viewed in the end. This conversion rate could be measured.

A multivariate testing strategy could be used to optimize the layout. The save video button positioning/styling could be tested across multiple split tests to find the optimal location/style. The recording playback page could also be optimized with a similar approach.
